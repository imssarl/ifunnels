Hi, {$user.buyer_name}<br/>
<br/>
We tried to process the 5 credits support and maintenance fee (as per our terms of service), but your balance was too low to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
To learn more about this Support & Maintenance program, read this entry in our Knowledge Base:<br/>
<a href="https://creativenichemanager.zendesk.com/entries/21668696-about-the-support-maintenance-program-5-credits-monthly-optional">https://creativenichemanager.zendesk.com/entries/21668696-about-the-support-maintenance-program-5-credits-monthly-optional</a><br/>
<br/>
If you wish to remain part of this program, then please kindly add more credits to your account: {Zend_Registry::get( 'config' )->domain->url}/registration/purchase_credits/<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to opt out from this program, you can do so by un-checking the corresponding box in your Profile Settings under My Account:<br/>
<a href="{Zend_Registry::get( 'config' )->domain->url}/user-settings/profile/">{Zend_Registry::get( 'config' )->domain->url}/user-settings/profile/</a><br/>
<br/>
We will try to deduct these 5 credit fees as soon as new credits are added to your account in case you do not update this option and leave it active.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
